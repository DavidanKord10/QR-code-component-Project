## My process

I first tried to center the elements, then I added the fonts, then I added the image and started to adjust the border.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts (Outfit)

### What I learned

I learned that my programming skills sucks... This "little" project just showed me I'm a complete noob, just for this "simple" project I used more than an hour. At the very start I was having difficulties to center the elements and I had to use chatgpt to tell me the problems (obviously I just asked the problems and didn't use chatgpt's solutions), just this problem alone used 1 hour of my time, the rest were okay.

### Continued development

I need to enhance my knowledge of the flexbox and the width and height numbers... I was pretty confused.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](chatgpt) - This helped me to find the problems.
